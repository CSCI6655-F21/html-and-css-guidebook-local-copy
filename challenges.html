						<p>This challenge reviews: <a href="/html/html-intro.html">Introduction to HTML</a>, <a href="/html/file-structure.html">Website File Structure</a>, <a href="/html/skeleton-code.html">Skeleton Code</a>, and <a href="/html/basic-text.html">Basic Text Elements</a>.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Create a new <strong>root directory</strong> for this website and name it <em>practical-challenge-site.</em> You will use this directory as the root for this project as we continue to add to it throughout these challenges</li>
							<li>Inside that directory, create a new html file and name it appropriately for a site <strong>home page</strong>.</li>
							<li>In your new home page file, add all the standard required <strong>skeleton code,</strong> don't forget to <strong>indent</strong> properly to show which elements are inside of which other elements.</li>
							<li>For the <code>title</code> element, use <span class="selectable">The Design of the 1960s</span>.</li>
							<li>Now, let's move inside of the <code>body</code> element for the rest of our work. Remember, the <code>body</code> element is what holds all the content that shows up on the webpage for users.</li>
							<li>First, let's add an <code>h1</code> element to serve as the primary heading for the page. Inside the element write <span class="selectable">The Design of the 1960s,</span> just as you did in the <code>title</code> element above.</li>
							<li>Next, add a <strong>paragraph</strong> with the following text:
								<div class="selectable">
									The nineteen-sixties were a vibrant time in the world of design in which increasing internationalism and experimentation flourished. This website pays tribute to some of the great designers and landmark design moments of that pivotal and unforgettable decade.
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>In the paragraph you just added, we want the user to know that the time period is <strong>important</strong>, so place the word <em>nineteen-sixties</em> in the appropriate HTML element to indicate importance.</li>
							<li>Let's also add a little <strong>emphasis</strong> to the words <em>internationalism</em> and <em>experimentalism</em> by adding the appropriate HTML element to them.</li>
							<li>Below the paragraph, add a new <strong>heading</strong> to indicate a sub-section of the page. The heading should be the appropriate number level to indicate that it is a direct <strong>sub-section of the <code>h1</code></strong> that describes the page above. The text of the heading should say <span class="selectable">Significant Designers.</span></li>
							<li>Below the heading you just added, create an <strong>unordered list</strong> (including the <strong>nesting</strong> shown) of the following names:
								<div class="selectable">
									<ul>
										<li>Paul Rand</li>
										<li>Muriel Cooper</li>
										<li>Ikko Tanaka</li>
										<li>The 
											<ul>
												<li>Ray Eames</li>
												<li>Charles Eames</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Saul Bass</li>
										<li>Margaret Calvert</li>
										<li>Yusaku Kamekura</li>
										<li>Herb Lubalin</li>
										<li>Shigeo Fukuda</li>
										<li>Milton Glaser</li>
										<li>Massimo Vignelli</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>After the unordered list, add another <strong>heading</strong> at the same level of hierarchy as the previous section heading and use the text <span class="selectable">Top Typefaces of 1960s Style.</span></li>
							<li>After this heading, we'll use another list, but since the list is ranked let's make it an <strong>ordered list.</strong> Here are the items to include:
								<div class="selectable"> 
									<ol>
										<li>Avant Garde</li>
										<li>Cooper Black</li>
										<li>Futura</li>
										<li>Helvetica</li>
										<li>Univers</li>
										<li>Eurostile</li>
										<li>Impact</li>
										<li>Sabon</li>
										<li>Bauhaus</li>
										<li>Baby Teeth</li>
									</ol>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>Finally, after the list of typefaces, let's add a credit to show who created this website. In the appropriate <strong>element for text that is less important</strong> add the text <span class="selectable">Website by Your Name.</span></li>
							<li>Congratulations! You've completed this challenge! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-1.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your work to it, making sure to check that:
								<ol>
									<li>All of your HTML elements are opened and closed in the correct places</li>
									<li>You have used proper spacing and capitalization.</li>
									<li>Your elements are correctly indented to show which elements are children of other elements.</li>

						<p>As you work, don't forget to frequently save your file and check it in your browser to see how everything displays.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>This challenge builds on the previous challenge, so open up the <code>index.html</code> file from last time to get started. If you didn't finish the previous challenge or haven't had time to make corrections, you can download the starter files above, which contain a completed version of the last challenge, and work from that instead.</li>
							<li>Now that we have the basic page content that we added in Challenge 1, let's add more meaning to the page by making use of the HTML5 semantic elements. We'll start by wrapping all the content inside the <code>body</code> element <em>except</em> for the <code>small</code> at the end of the page in the appropriate element for <strong>the primary content of a page</strong>. Be sure to update your indentation to show the new parent/child relationship between elements.</li>
							<li>Inside the element you just added, find the <code>h2</code> that says "Significant Designers" and the unordered list of designer names. Wrap both that heading and the list in the element that means <strong>a group of thematically related content</strong>.</li>
							<li>Now use another instance of the same element you used in Step 3 to wrap the <code>h2</code> that says "Top Typefaces of 1960s Style" along with the unordered list of typefaces.</li>
							<li>Now let's turn our attention to the <code>small</code> element at the end that contains the "written by" statement. Wrap that element in the semantic element that refers to <strong>information about the creator or creation of a page or article</strong>.</li>
							<li>Now our page has semantic elements for the primary content and for the creator's credit, but it lacks anything to introduce the site. Above the element for primary content that you added in Step 2, just after the opening <code>body</code> tag, add the semantic element for <strong>introductory content about a page or article</strong>.</li>
							<li>Inside the element you just added, let's add some text that will serve the role of our site's logo. Since there is no element specifically for logos, add <strong>a block element that is meaningless</strong> and fill it with this text: <span class="selectable">The History of Design</span>, which will be the name of our site as a whole.</li>
							<li>Let's add some visual interest to the site by adding an image. But first, we need a place to put the image file. We could place it directly in our root directory, but keeping images with all the pages could lead to poor organization down the road. Instead, directly <strong>inside your root directory, create a new directory named <span class="selectable">images</span>.</strong></li>
							<li><a href="/challenge-files/rockroll.jpg" download>Download this image file</a> and place it inside your new images directory.</li>
							<li>Now, back in your <code>index.html</code> file, directly below the <code>h1</code> and above the paragraph, <strong>add the HTML to include the image on your page.</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>Remember to include the required attribute for users who can't see the image. Use the text: <span class="selectable">Rock and Roll Poster</span>.</li>
									<li>Be sure to save and check your page in the browser to ensure the image shows up.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Congratulations! Another challenge complete! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-2.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your own work against it, making sure to check that:

					<div class="challenge-content">
						<p>As you work, don't forget to frequently save your file and check it in your browser to see how everything displays.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>This challenge builds on the previous challenges, so open up the <code>index.html</code> file from last time to get started. If you didn't finish the previous challenge or haven't had time to make corrections, you can download the starter files above, which contain a completed version of the last challenge, and work from that instead.</li>

							<li>So far we've only used HTML to add content to this site, but it looks really plain, so let's begin adding some style. The first thing we'll need to do is <strong>add a CSS file named <span class="selectable">style.css</span> directly inside the root directory</strong> of the website.</li>
							<li>But our HTML file doesn't yet know about the CSS file. In the <code>head</code> of <code>index.html</code>, <strong>add the necessary code to tell the browser to use the CSS file</strong> you just created.</li>
							<li>One of the primary factors that determines the look and feel of a design is the type, so let's get started by setting a typeface for all the body copy. In your CSS file, <strong>select for the HTML element that contains all other HTML elements and apply this font stack:</strong> <span class="selectable">Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif</span>. Selecting the topmost parent element like this should result in the type being used by all elements on the page.</li>
							<li>Now the spacing between the lines in the body copy feels too tight. Let's fix that by <strong>setting the space between lines to <code>1.5</code></strong>. (Notice that we don't need a unit for this measurement.)</li>
							<li>To add a bit of variety to the site, in your CSS <strong>select for <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, and <code>h3</code> (there aren't any h3s on the page yet, but we may add some in the future) and apply the font stack:</strong> <span class="selectable">Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif</span>.
								<ol>
									<li>What is the most efficient way you can write the CSS to apply this font stack to the headings listed?</li>
									<li>Note that because this is applied to specific elements within the element you used in Step 4, the font overrides the Georgia fonts for these headings.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>While we're styling the headings, let's add some other styles for a bit of flavor. To the same three headings you used in the previous step, give them a <strong>text color</strong> of <span class="selectable">#AE053E</span>.</li>
							<li>To make the page title really stand out, do the following to <strong>just the</strong> <code>h1</code>:
								<ol>
									<li>Make the text <strong>all capital letters</strong> using CSS.</li>
									<li>Make the type a <strong>regular weight</strong> instead of the default bold.</li>
									<li>Add <code>.1rem</code> of extra <strong>spacing between all the letters</strong>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>To make the page feel a little more impactful, let's <strong>increase the size of the headings</strong> to the following values:
								<ol>
									<li>Make the <code>h1</code> elements <code>3.5rem</code>.</li>
									<li>Make the <code>h2</code> elements <code>2rem</code>.</li>
									<li>Make the <code>h3</code> elements <code>1.5rem</code>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Finally, since the first paragraph on the page explains what the website is all about, let's give it some special visual treatment. Since we want to apply these styles only to this one particular paragraph and not all paragraphs we might add in the future, we can't select it using the <code>p</code> element. So do the following instead:
								<ol>
									<li>In your HTML file, <strong>add a class of</strong> <span class="selectable">site-intro</span>.</li>
									<li>Back in your CSS, select for the class you just added and <strong>set the type size to</strong> <code>1.25rem</code>.</li> 
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>All done! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-3.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your own work against it, making sure to check that:
								<ol>
									<li>Your CSS is correctly formatted, with proper indentation, spacing, and alphabetized properties.</li>
									<li>You have selected for the different headings in the most efficient way possible.</li>
									<li>The class you added to your HTML is formatted correctly.</li>
								</ol>

					<div class="challenge-meta">

					<div class="challenge-content">
						<p>As you work, don't forget to frequently save your file and check it in your browser to see how everything displays.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>This challenge builds on the previous challenges, so open up your files from last time to get started. If you didn't finish the previous challenge or haven't had time to make corrections, you can download the starter files above, which contain a completed version of the last challenge, and work from that instead.</li>

							<li>Right now, all the content stretches all the way across the page, with almost no space at the edges, and on wide browsers the lines of body text can become too long to read comfortably. To fix this, in your CSS set the <code>main</code> element to <strong>never grow wider</strong> than <code>38rem</code>.</li>
							<li>That's better, but the content now sits to the left side of the page on browsers that are wider than <code>38rem</code>. To fix this, <strong>use margin to horizontally center the <code>main</code> in the available space</strong>.</li>
							<li>Now that the formatting is looking better, let's pay attention to some details. The <em>Significant Designers</em> section of the page has an unordered list that looks a little plain. Use CSS to set <strong>all unordered lists to show a square instead of a black disc</strong> as the list item marker.</li>
							<li>That looks good, but the nested list shouldn't show the same marker as the parent list. <strong>Set the list marker of nested unordered lists to be a hollow circle</strong>.</li>
							<li>On a related note, for fun let's <strong>change the <em>ordered</em> lists to use numbers with a leading zero</strong> instead of the standard single digit style.</li>
							<li>As our page takes shape I'm noticing that some of the headings still look a little plain. To fix this, let's make the following changes to all <code>h2</code> elements:
								<ol>
									<li>Give them a <strong>solid line border across the bottom that is <span class="selectable">5px</span> thick and the same color as the text</strong>.</li>
									<li>Add <span class="selectable">.5rem</span> of <strong>space between the bottom of the text and the border</strong>.</li>
									<li>Add the following space <strong>between the element and the surrounding contents:</strong> <span class="selectable">4rem</span> of space on top, no space on the sides, and <span class="selectable">2rem</span> of space on bottom. 
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Lastly, let's start planning for when we add additional pages to this website. Specifically, in <code>index.html</code> let's add a list of items to serve as the main navigation of the site by doing the following:
								<ol>
									<li>Inside the page's <code>header</code> element, just after the <code>div</code> with the site name, <strong>add the semantic element appropriate for page navigation</strong>.</li>
									<li>Inside the element you just added, write an <strong>unordered list that contains the following items</strong> (just the text for now; we'll make them links in a future challenge):
										<div class="selectable">
											<ul>
												<li>Home</li>
												<li>About</li>
												<li>Contact</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>To the list as a whole, <strong>add a class of <span class="selectable">site-nav-list</span></strong> so we can target it in our CSS and style it differently from other unordered lists.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>The navigation list we just added contains the right information, but it doesn't look how users expect navigation to look. To fix this, jump back into your CSS file and do the following:
								<ol>
									<li>Change the <strong>display property of the list items so that they sit side-by-side</strong>. Remember, you only want to affect the list items in this navigation list, so you'll need to be sure to write a <strong>CSS selector that only targets list items within the "site-nav-list" unordered list</strong>.</li>
									<li>On the "site-nav-list" list itself, there's some default space inside the element on the left side. <strong>Remove the default space from the list</strong>.</li>
									
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>That's it for this challenge! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-4.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your own work against it, making sure to check that:
								<ol>
									<li>You have used the correct selectors for everything you added to your CSS.</li>
									<li>You have chosen correctly between the margin and padding properties everywhere that you changed spacing.</li>
									<li>You used shorthand where possible for margin and padding.</li>
									<li>All your CSS properties are nicely alphabetized within the selector blocks.</li>
									<li>You added the correct semantic element in your HTML.</li>
								</ol>

						<ol>
							<li>This challenge builds on the previous challenges, so open up your files from last time to get started. Or you can download the starter files above, which contain a completed version of the last challenge, and work from that instead.</li>

							<li>So far, our website is very self-contained. Let's broaden our horizons a bit by setting up some links. In the introductory paragraph of <code>index.html</code>, <strong>make the words "landmark design moments" a link</strong> that points to this article: <span class="selectable">https://www.printmag.com/post/vintage-graphic-design-ads-1960s</span>. Be sure to test the link in your browser to make sure it works correctly.</li>

							<li>Now, let's do some linking <em>within</em> our own website. First we'll need to create at least one more page:
								<ol>
									<li>Inside your root directory <strong>create a new directory named:</strong> <span class="selectable">designers</span>.</li>
									<li><strong>Create a new HTML file</strong> in your <em>designers</em> directory and name it <span class="selectable">ikko-tanaka.html</span>.</li>
									<li>In the new HTML file, <strong>add all required skeleton code</strong> and for the <code>title</code> element use: <span class="selectable">Ikko Tanaka | The Design of the 1960s</span>.</li>
									<li>Also in the new HTML file, <strong>add the link to your CSS file</strong>, making sure the file path that correctly points to <code>style.css</code> in the parent of the current directory.</li>
									<li>Inside the <code>body</code> element, <strong>copy and paste in from the home page</strong> the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> along with their contents, then between them <strong>add</strong> an empty <code>main</code> element to hold the unique content we'll write for the page.</li>
									<li>Inside the newly added <code>main</code> element, <strong>add a top-level heading</strong> that says <span class="selectable">Ikko Tanaka</span>.</li>
									<li>Below the heading, <strong>add two paragraphs</strong> with the following content:
										<div class="selectable">
											<p>Born in Nara, Japan in 1930, Ikko Tanaka created a style of graphic design that fused modernism principles and aesthetics with the Japanese tradition. As a child he studied art and as a young adult he was involved in modern drama and theatrical study groups. In 1963 he formed Tanaka Design Studio where he worked for corporations such as Mazda, Hanae Mori, Issey Miyake and the International Garden and Greenery Exhibition.</p>
											<p>He is most well-known for his poster design for the Nihon Buyo performance by the Asian Performing Arts Institute. The poster (pictured above) shows his fusion of modernist sensibilities and traditional Japanese culture through the simplified illustration of a geisha. He designed, among other things, posters, logos, packaging and annual reports. Among his wide ranging work, his designs for the symbols for the Expo '85 in Tsukuba and the World City Expo Tokyo '96 garnered much attention. He died in 2002 of a heart attack at the age of 71.</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li>Because all of this information could stand alone if taken out of context it, <strong>wrap</strong> everything inside the <code>main</code> element in the appropriate semantic element for <strong>content that could stand alone as its own document</strong>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Now let's briefly switch back to <code>index.html</code>. In the list of significant designers, find Ikko Tanaka's name and <strong>link it to the new page</strong> about him. Remember to think about the <em>designers</em> directory when writing the path of your link. Make sure the link is placed <em>inside</em> the list item, not the other way around.</li>
							<li>Back in <code>ikko-tanaka.html</code>, let's provide a way for users to get back to the home page. We've already added <em>home</em> as one of the list items in the <code>nav</code> of our page <code>header</code>, so <strong>link that to the home page,</strong> remembering to consider the directory relationship between files when you write the file path.</li>
							<li>We want to keep the navigation the same on all pages, so <strong>copy the modified <em>home</em> link</strong> from <code>ikko-tanaka.html</code> and paste it in to <strong>replace the existing <em>home</em> item in the home page <code>nav></code></strong>. Then <strong>modify the link</strong> for <em>home</em> so that it correctly links to itself. (It's pretty common for page navigation to have links that point to the current page.)</li>
							<li>Finally, let's move into our CSS file and add some styles for all our links and their various possible states:
								<ol>
									<li>For <strong>default</strong> links, change the text color to: <span class="selectable">#006EAC</span>.</li>
									<li>For <strong>visited</strong> links, change the color to: <span class="selectable">#2A4758</span>.</li>
									<li>For <strong>hovered</strong> links, change the color to: <span class="selectable">white</span>, and set the background color to: <span class="selectable">#006EAC</span>.</li>
									<li>For <strong>focused</strong> links, change the color to: <span class="selectable">white</span>, and set the background color to: <span class="selectable">#AE053E</span>.</li>
									<li>For <strong>active</strong> links, change the color to: <span class="selectable">white</span>, and set the background color to: <span class="selectable">black</span>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>

							<li>That's it for this challenge! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-5.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your own work against it, making sure to check that:
								<ol>
									<li>All your links work as intended.</li>
									<li>Nothing is missing from your new HTML.</li>
									<li>All the styles for your link states are written correctly and work as intended.</li>
								</ol>

									<li>In your <code>ikko-tanaka.html</code> code, below the <code>h1</code>, <strong>add the image</strong> to the page. Remember as you write the file path to the image that your current file is in a sub-directory.</li>
									<li>For the <code>alt</code> attribute, use the text <span class="selectable">Nihon Buyo poster by Ikko Tanaka</span>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Since this image helps users to understand Tanaka's design, <strong>wrap the image in the appropriate semantic element</strong> that means <em>a visual example of the topic referenced in the text</em>.</li>
							<li>The default styles for the element you just added in step 3 add a bit of awkward space to the left side of the image. Use your developer tools to figure out what is causing the extra space and, in your CSS file, <strong>remove the space from the left side of this type of element</strong>.</li>
							<li>Now, let's make some more specific design changes. Since we don't want to affect all image examples, we'll need to first <strong>add the following class to the element you added in step 3:</strong> <span class="selectable">design-example</span>. Now we can reuse the same class for similar examples on pages about other designers.</li>
							<li>Now, in your CSS, <strong>select for the <code>design-example</code> class</strong> and do the following:
								<ol>
									<li>Make it so the element will <strong>never be wider than 30% of the parent</strong>.</li>
									<li>Make it so the element <strong>moves to the right side of the parent with the text wrapping around its left side</strong>.</li>
									<li>We don't want the text to butt up against the image awkwardly, so <strong>add <code>1rem</code> of space</strong> on both the <strong>left and bottom sides</strong> of the element.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>If you save your files and check them in your browser, you'll notice that the image actually hangs out of the column of the text. This is because we've set the element that contains it to a size smaller than the image file itself, so we need to tell the image to shrink to fit within its parent. It's a good idea to make this adjustment to all images everywhere so we don't run into the same problem again. To do so, in your CSS <strong>select for all image elements</strong> and apply the following:
								<ol>
									<li>Set images to <strong>never grow wider than 100% of the parent</strong>.</li>
									<li>While we're at it, let's make the behavior of images more predictable by setting images to <strong>behave as a <span>block</span> element</strong> rather than as an <span>inline</span> element.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Now let's switch gears. When we chose our typefaces for the site we didn't know yet how to use webfonts and so we used system fonts. Now, let's take advantage of a wider selection by implementing some Google Fonts:
								<ol>
									<li>Go to Google Fonts and select <strong>the bold weight only of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald">Oswald</a></strong> and <strong>the regular, regular italic, and bold weights of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>.</li>
									<li><strong>Add the Google Fonts embed code</strong> to the <code>head</code> of <strong>each</strong> HTML file in your project.</li>
									<li>In your CSS, <strong>replace the font declaration on the <code>HTML</code> element with Merriweather</strong>.</li>
									<li>In your CSS, <strong>replace the font declaration for the headings with Oswald</strong>.</li>
									<li>Since we only brought in the bold weight of Oswald, <strong>remove the declaration that sets the <code>h1</code> to have a normal font weight</strong>.</li>

								</ol>
							</li>

							<li>That's it, another challenge complete! Now download the <a href="/challenge-files/challenge-6.zip" download>finished version</a> and compare your own work against it, making sure to check that:
								<ol>
									<li>You've used the correct semantic element for your image.</li>
									<li>You've styled the image and its parent element correctly in your CSS.</li>
									<li>You have the correct embed code for the Google Fonts.</li>
									<li>Double check your indentation.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>

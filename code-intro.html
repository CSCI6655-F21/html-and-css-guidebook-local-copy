				<h1>What is a Website?</h1>

				<p>We're all familiar with websites in that we use them every day. On our phones, our desktops, our laptops, even our watches. But to be able to <em>make</em> a website, you need to <em>really</em> understand what exactly a website is on a fundamental level, beyond what a casual user sees.</p>

				<nv class="page-nav">
					<h2>On This Page</h2>
					<a href="#content">A Language for Content</a>
					<a href="#elements">Elements</a>
					<a href="#semantics">Semantics</a>
					<a href="#attributes">Attributes</a>
					<a href="#files">HTML Files</a>
				</nav>

			<h2 id="content">What is the Internet?</h2>
			
			<p>The internet is basically a network of computers; that is, a bunch of computers that are able to talk to one another. This includes all kinds of computers, but most importantly for our purposes, it includes a special type of computer called a <strong>server</strong>.</p>
			
			<p class="big-point">A server is like a house for web content.</p>
			
			<p>The purpose of a server is to store and provide access to all sorts of web content, from video files, to images, to databases of information. And most fundamentally, servers store the code files from which websites are made.</p>
			
			<p>We'll talk more about code files shortly.</p>
			
			<h3>IP Address</h3>
			
			<p>Every computer on the internet has a unique address called an <strong>IP (Internet Protocal) Address</strong>. This includes all the devices you use to access the internet: your phone, your PC, even smart lightbulbs. The IP address is how computers find each other to have a conversation. And of course this includes servers.</p>
			
			<p>So when your computer wants to talk to a server that houses the content for a particular wenbsite, it has to find that server using its unique IP address.</p>
			
			<p>The problem is that IP addresses are long strings of numbers and dots (e.g. 123.456.78.90), which aren't very easy for humans to remember. It would be terrible if I had to manually enter a number like that for every site I wanted to visit!</p>

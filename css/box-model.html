				<h1>The Box Model</h1>

				<p>The Box Model describes how block elements are <strong>sized</strong> and <strong>spaced</strong> using CSS. The primary properties involved in determining the box model for an element are presented here.</p>

			<h2  id="dimensions-section">width &amp; height</h2>

			<p>By default, a block element is as wide as the container and as tall as the content it contains. Let's look at an example div that contains some text. (We'll give it a background color to make it easier to see the box.)</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p>We can apply a set width and/or height to change the size however we want:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	height: 20rem;
	width: 80%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try changing the values for the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties.</p>

			<p>However, we need to be careful about setting a height because if there is too much content, it will grow outside of the container:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	height: 4rem;
	width: 80%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p>So, in general, it's good to let height take care of itself in most cases.</p>
			
			<p class="big-point">Using a set height can cause problems if the text needs more lines than the height provides, so it is safest to leave the height to be automatically determined.</p>

			<h3>max-width/height &amp; min-width/height</h3>

			<p>These related properties allow you to set a maximum width or height up to which an element may expand, or a minimum width or height down to which an element may shrink. These properties can be combined to work together:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	max-width: 250px;
	min-width: 200px;
	width: 40%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p class="try-this">Try resizing the demo preview window by grabbing the bottom right corner and dragging. Notice how element grows, but only up to 250px, and it shrinks, but only down to 200px.</p>


			<h2 id="padding-section">padding</h2>

			<p>Padding defines space <em>within</em> an element, between the edge of the box and the content the element contains. The simple <strong>padding</strong> property is shorthand for <strong>padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left.</strong> (Notice that the properties in the shorthand are ordered clockwise, starting at the top.)</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	padding: 1rem 2rem 10px 20px;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the demo above, try changing the values for <code>padding</code> on different sides of the element. Notice how the content is pushed away from the edges of the box.</p>

			<p>There are also further condensed versions of the shorthand:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Three values:</strong> top, left &amp; right together, bottom.</li>

				<li><strong>Two values:</strong> top &amp; bottom together, left &amp; right together.</li>

				<li><strong>One value:</strong> all sides.</li>
			</ul>

			<code-block lang="css" code='.top-leftright-bottom {
	padding: 1rem 2rem 10px;
}

.topbottom-leftright {
	padding: 1rem 2rem;
}

.topbottomleftright {
	padding: 3rem;
}'></code-block>

			<p>You can, of course, use the non-shorthand properties for individual sides:</p>

			<code-block lang="css" code='.one-side-only {
	padding-left: 3rem;
}'></code-block>

			<p>Notice that the padding is <em>added</em> to the existing dimensions of the box, unless the box already fills its container (as in a full-width box), in which case it pushes the content in to make room for the padding.</p>


			<h2 id="margin-section">margin</h2>

			<p>Margin defines space <em>around</em> an element, between the element and its neighbors. As with padding, The simple <strong>margin</strong> property is shorthand for <strong>margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left.</strong> We'll need two divs for our demonstration.</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	margin: 1rem 2rem 10px 20px;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the demo above, try changing the values for <code>margin</code> on the various sides. Note how the boxes are spaced away from each other and from the edges of the preview window in response.</p>

			<p>Notice that the divs are pushed away from each other and from the edges of the container (the body) by the amounts specified in the margin. Where there is room (like the vertical direction here), the margin is added to the space the box already uses. However, where there is no room (as in the horizontal direction, here constrained by the body), the margin pushes into the space the box uses.</p>

			<p>All the same shorthand rules apply as with padding. The properties in the shorthand are ordered clockwise, starting at the top. The same three, two, and single value versions are available, and the same single-side properties are available.</p>

			<code-block lang="css" code='.top-leftright-bottom {
	margin: 1rem 2rem 10px;
}

.topbottom-leftright {
	margin: 1rem 2rem;
}

.topbottomleftright {
	margin: 3rem;
}

.one-side-only {
	margin-left: 3rem;
}'></code-block>

			<h3>Horizontal Centering with Margin</h3>

			<p>A handy feature of <strong>margin</strong> is that it allows horizontal centering of an element using the <em>auto</em> value, which simply takes up the available space. For example:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	margin: 0 auto; /*0 top and bottom, auto left and right*/
	width: 50%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the demo above, try resizing the preview window by grabbing the bottom tight corner and dragging. Notice how the element always stays horizontally centered.</p>


			<h2 id="border-section">border</h2>

			<p>Border, no surprise, used to add a stroke to the outer edge of an element. It consists of three relevant properties:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>border-width:</strong> which uses a sizing value to set the thickness of the stroke. Required for the border to work.</li>

				<li><strong>border-style:</strong> defines the look of the border. Some common values are: <em>dotted, dashed, solid,</em> and <em>double.</em> Required for the border to work.</li>

				<li><strong>border-color:</strong> defines the color of the border. Optional. If no color is defined, the border will match the color of the text.</li>
			</ul>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	border-color: green;
	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 2px;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the demo above, try playing around with the different <code>border</code> values. See what happens when you change the color or the width. For the style, try out values such as <code>dotted</code> or <code>dashed</code>.</p>

			<p>Border is applied outside of padding:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	border-color: green;
	border-style: solid;
	border-width: 2px;
	padding: 2rem;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p>There is also a <strong>shorthand</strong> property for border (just <strong>border</strong>). The order of values is strict (and space-separated): <em>border-width border-style border-color(optional)</em>.</p>

			<code-block lang="css" code='.example-div-border-shorthand {
	border: 2px solid green;
}'></code-block>

			<p>There are also <strong>single-side</strong> versions of all border properties, including the shorthand:</p>

			<code-block lang="css" code='.example-div-border-left {
	border-left-color: green;
	border-left-style: solid;
	border-left-width: 2px;
}

.example-div-border-left-shorthand {
	border-left: 2px solid;
}'></code-block>

			<p>As with padding and margin, border is added to the total size of an element, unless there is no room, in which case it pushes the content in to make room.</p>


			<h2 id="box-sizing-section">box-sizing</h2>

			<p>As mentioned in the previous sections, by default, padding and border are <em>added</em> to the starting size of an element. This means that in cases where the size of a box is defined using width and/or height, if padding or border are added, the final size of the box is larger than the size originally defined. Like so:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	border: 10px solid;
	padding: 3rem;
	width: 50%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p>As you can see, the div is larger than 50% of the width of the container because the padding and border are added to that.</p>

			<p>With the <strong>box-sizing</strong> property, we can set the padding and border to <em>push in</em> from the defined size of an element rather than adding to it using the value <strong>border-box</strong>. This allows you to preserve your intended sizing:</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;div class="example-div"&gt;"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight oclock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.."&lt;/div&gt;'

			css-code='.example-div{
	background-color: powderblue;
	border: 10px solid;
	box-sizing: border-box;
	padding: 3rem;
	width: 50%;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>

			<p>With border-box applied, the box is now exactly 50% of the container and the padding and border have been added <em>within</em> that space.</p>

			<p>This feature is incredibly useful.</p>

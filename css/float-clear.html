				<h1>Float &amp; Clear</h1>
				
				<p>Floats are a tool for wrapping text or other content around a particular element. Once used broadly for layouts, floats are now, more properly, used primarily for basic text flows.</p>

				<nav class="page-nav">
					<h2>On This Page</h2>

			<h2 id="float">Float</h2>

			<p>The CSS <code>float</code> property allows you to place an element on either the <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> side of the container while other content wraps or flows around it on the opposite side.</p>

			<p>An element can be floated <code>right</code>:</p>

			<!--Example Pen-->
			<div 
			  class="codepen" 
			  data-prefill 
			  data-height="400"
			  data-editable="true"
			  data-theme-id="36581"
			  data-default-tab="css,result" 
			>
				<pre data-lang="css">.float-image-example {
	float: right;
	margin: 0 0 .5rem .5rem;
}</pre>

				<pre data-lang="html">&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dog-lick-03-1533228266.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=100:*" alt="dog" class="float-image-example"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

			</div>

			<p>An element can also be floated <code>left</code>:</p>

			<!--Example Pen-->
			<div 
			  class="codepen" 
			  data-prefill 
			  data-height="400"
			  data-editable="true"
			  data-theme-id="36581"
			  data-default-tab="css,result" 
			>
				<pre data-lang="css">.float-image-example {
	float: left;
	margin: 0 .5rem .5rem 0;
}</pre>

				<pre data-lang="html">&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dog-lick-03-1533228266.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=100:*" alt="dog" class="float-image-example"&gt;

The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

			</div>

			<p>You can also <em>disable</em> a previously set float using <code>float: none;</code></p>



			<h2 id="clear">Clear</h2>

			<p>When an element is floated, all following content will wrap around it, so long as there is space. For example:</p>

			<!--Example Pen-->
			<div 
			  class="codepen" 
			  data-prefill 
			  data-height="400"
			  data-editable="true"
			  data-theme-id="36581"
			  data-default-tab="css,result" 
			>
				<pre data-lang="css">.float-image-example {
	float: left;
	margin: 0 .5rem .5rem 0;
}</pre>

				<pre data-lang="html">&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/filestore.rescuegroups.org/2736/pictures/animals/13088/13088121/60231003_100x300.jpg" alt="cat" class="float-image-example"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Nine Lives&lt;/h5&gt;</pre>

			</div>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above examples, try removing the floats. What happens to the layout without them? What happens when you add them back in? What about when you change the side to which the image is floated?</p>



			<p class="post-clear-example">Note that the image sticks out of the bottom of the container. This is because floated elements are not considered in the height of a container.</p>

			<p>For an element that follows an element that is floated, you can apply the <code>clear</code> property to cause it to break to below the floated element rather than wrapping to its side.</p>
			
			<p class="big-point">The clear property exists to stop an element from wrapping around another element that is floated.</p>

			<p><code>clear</code> can accept a value of <code>left</code> to clear an element floated left, <code>right</code> to clear an element floated right, or <code>both</code>, which clears all floats.</p>

			<p>A good metaphor for <code>clear</code> is that it is like an invisible bar at the top of the element that sticks out to the side defined and forces the element to below anything the bar hits.</p>

			<!--Example Pen-->
			<div 
			  class="codepen" 
			  data-prefill 
			  data-height="400"
			  data-editable="true"
			  data-theme-id="36581"
			  data-default-tab="css,result" 
			>
				<pre data-lang="css">.float-image-example {
	float: left;
	margin: 0 .5rem .5rem 0;
}

h5 {
	clear: both;
}</pre>

				<pre data-lang="html">&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/filestore.rescuegroups.org/2736/pictures/animals/13088/13088121/60231003_100x300.jpg" alt="cat" class="float-image-example"&gt;

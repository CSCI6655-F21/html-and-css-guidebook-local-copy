				<h1>CSS Typography</h1>
				
				<p>The majority of content on a typical website consists of text, so it is no surprise that CSS offers many properties for <strong>typographic customization</strong>. The art of typography is of course a subject all its own, but here are some of the most common type-related CSS properties.</p>
				
				<p>Slightly more advanced typographic techniques and considerations are discussed in the second video lesson on <a href="#video">intermediate typography</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="family">font-family</h2>

			<p><code>font-family</code> provides a list of fonts to use. The reason for providing multiple fonts is that the browser checks a user's system to see if the font is available. If it is not, it moves on to the next font specified. By providing a generic font type, like "sans-serif", it insures that a user's browser can use its default in the style if no other requested fonts are installed.</p>

			<p class="big-point">Font names that <strong>contain space characters</strong> should be wrapped in <strong>quotation marks</strong>.</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;p&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What has happened to me?" he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

			css-code='p {
	font-family: Geneva, "Lucida Sans", Verdana, sans-serif;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>


			<h2 id="size">font-size</h2>

			<p>Fonts can be sized using most CSS size units. (See the <a href="https://codepen.io/JosiahACC/pen/OQVrva">reference guide</a>.) If percentages are used, the font will be sized as a percentage of the parent element's font size.</p>

			<p><code>rem</code> units are a great choice.</p>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

				'

			css-code='p {
	font-size: 1.2rem;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try changing the size in <code>rem</code> units to see what happens to the type. Can you think of other sizing units to try? What happens when you sue them?</p>


			<h2 id="weight">font-weight</h2>

			<p><code>font-weight</code> determines whether the type displays as bold, normal, light, etcetera. The value can be set with keywords like "bold" or "normal", or with numeric values in increments of 100, with 400 as the equivalent of "normal".</p>

			css-code='p {
	font-weight: bold;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>


			<h2 id="style">font-style</h2>

			<p><code>font-style</code> determines whether the type is normal or italic.</p>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

				'

			css-code='p {
	font-style: italic;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>


			<h2 id="color">color</h2>

			<p>There are a number of formats in which colors can be expressed in CSS. For a deeper explanation, see the <a href="https://codepen.io/JosiahACC/pen/qxdLMX">chapter on color formats</a>.</p>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

				'

			css-code='p {
	color: #4286f4;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>


			<h2 id="height">line-height</h2>

			<p><code>line-height</code> requires no units for the value. By default, the value is relative to the size of the type, so if the value is 2, the line-height is twice the font-size.</p>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

"What has happened to me?" he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
				'

			css-code='p {
	line-height: 1.7;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try changing the number to adjust the <code>line-height</code>.</p>


			<h2 id="transform">text-transform</h2>

			<p><code>text-transform</code> allows you to change the case of the text through CSS. It is usually better to do this in CSS rather than in the HTML because it is usually a style choice rather than a part of the meaning of the text.</p>

			<p>Common values are: <em>capitalize, uppercase, lowercase,</em> and <em>none.</em> None simply gets rid of any values applied elsewhere.</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;p&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
				'

			css-code='p {
	text-transform: uppercase;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try out the different values for <code>text-transform</code>. What happens when you try <code>capitalize</code>, <code>lowercase</code>, or <code>none</code>?</p>


			<h2 id="decoration">text-decoration</h2>

			<p><code>text-decoration</code> allows you to add or remove decorative elements applied to text, such as underlines or strike-throughs.</p>

			<p>Common values are: <em>underline, overline, line-through,</em> and <em>none.</em> None simply gets rid of any values applied elsewhere.</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;p&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
				'

			css-code='p {
	text-decoration: underline;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try out the different values for <code>text-decoration</code>. What happens when you try <code>overline</code>, <code>line-through</code>, or <code>none</code>?</p>


			<h2 id="spacing">letter-spacing</h2>

			<p><code>letter-spacing</code> controls the tracking or amount of space between each pair of letters. <code>em</code> is often a good choice of unit for this property because it is relative to the type to which it is applied.</p>

			<pen-demo html-code='&lt;p&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
				'

			css-code='p {
	letter-spacing: .3em;
}'
			selected-tab="css"
		></pen-demo>
			
			<p class="try-this">In the above example, try out the different values and different measurement units for <code>letter-spacing</code> to see what happens.</p>
